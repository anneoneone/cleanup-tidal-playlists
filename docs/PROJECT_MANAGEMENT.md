# Modern Project Management Setup

This document describes the modern project management structure implemented for the Tidal Cleanup project.

## Overview

The project now follows modern Python development best practices with:

- **Modern Dependency Management**: pyproject.toml with build system
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline  
- **Developer Experience**: Makefile, tox, and automated tooling
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and security policies

```

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd cleanup-tidal-playlists
make dev-setup
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run quality checks
make lint

# Run tests
make test-cov

# Full pre-commit check
make pr-check
```

### Quality Gates

Every commit and PR goes through:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: 15+ automated checks
2. **CI Pipeline**: Matrix testing across Python versions
3. **Security Scanning**: Dependency and code security checks
4. **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement

## Tools and Configuration

### Dependency Management

- **pyproject.toml**: Modern Python packaging standard
- **PEP 517/518**: Build system specification
- **Optional Dependencies**: Separate dev, test, docs requirements

### Code Quality

- **Black**: Code formatting (88 char limit)
- **isort**: Import sorting (Black profile) 
- **flake8**: Linting with plugins
- **mypy**: Type checking (strict mode)
- **bandit**: Security linting
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Testing

- **pytest**: Test framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **tox**: Multi-environment testing
- **Matrix CI**: Python 3.8-3.12 across OS

### Automation

- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for quality
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependabot**: Dependency updates
- **Security Advisories**: Vulnerability disclosure

## Configuration Files

### pyproject.toml

Central configuration for:
- Package metadata and dependencies
- Build system configuration  
- Tool settings (black, isort, mypy, pytest)
- Entry points and scripts

### .pre-commit-config.yaml

Automated checks for:
- Code formatting and style
- Import sorting and linting
- Type checking and security
- Documentation and commit messages

### GitHub Actions

CI/CD pipeline with:
- Quality checks and security scans
- Matrix testing across environments
- Build and release automation
- Deployment to PyPI

## Security

### Automated Security

- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot and advisories
- **Pre-commit**: Security checks on every commit

### Security Policy

- Vulnerability reporting process
- Response timeline commitments
- Supported version matrix
- Security best practices

## Branch Protection

Recommended GitHub branch protection:

- Require PR reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require signed commits
- Restrict pushes to admins only

## Release Process

Automated release workflow:

1. **Version Bump**: Update version in pyproject.toml and __init__.py
2. **Changelog**: Update CHANGELOG.md
3. **Tag**: Create and push git tag
4. **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and publish
5. **GitHub Release**: Automated release creation

## Developer Commands

```bash
# Setup
make dev-setup              # Full development setup
make install-dev           # Install with dev dependencies

# Quality
make format                # Format code (black, isort)
make lint                  # Run all linting
make security              # Security checks
make pr-check              # Full PR validation

# Testing  
make test                  # Run tests
make test-cov              # Tests with coverage
make test-all              # Multi-environment testing

# Building
make build                 # Build package
make release               # Prepare release

# Utilities
make clean                 # Clean artifacts
make help                  # Show available commands
```

## Benefits

### For Developers

- **Consistent Environment**: Standardized tooling and configuration
- **Fast Feedback**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues early
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and security checks
- **Easy Onboarding**: Single command setup

### For Project

- **Maintainability**: Modern structure and best practices
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing across environments

## Migration Benefits

From the legacy setup, we now have:

- ✅ **Modern Packaging**: pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Automated checks instead of manual
- ✅ **Security**: Continuous monitoring instead of ad-hoc
- ✅ **Testing**: Matrix testing instead of local-only
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides instead of none
- ✅ **Automation**: CI/CD pipeline instead of manual releases

This creates a professional, maintainable, and secure development environment that scales with the project's growth.
